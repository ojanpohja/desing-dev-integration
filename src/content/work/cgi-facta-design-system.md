## Context
Public-sector information systems with complex workflows and multi-stakeholder needs. Goal: modernize UX and align teams on a shared system.

## Role & scope
- Lead design strategy and system direction for Facta
- Establish federated design system foundations (tokens, components, governance)
- Mentor designers; facilitate cross-team rituals (crits, reviews)
- Partner with product, engineering, and architecture

## Outcomes
- Shared token vocabulary → faster, more consistent UI decisions
- Reduced drift across teams; easier onboarding
- Clear governance and quality gates (accessibility, contrast, tokens lint)
