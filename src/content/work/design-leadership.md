## Context
We scaled a team from 2 → 12 in nine months while introducing weekly design crit, quality gates, and a token-led design system foundation.

## Outcomes
- Hiring pipeline with 4-week median time-to-offer
- Crit ritual → higher cross-team alignment
- Shared token vocabulary with engineering
