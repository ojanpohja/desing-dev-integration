I lead design strategy and multidisciplinary collaboration within CGI’s built environment product portfolio, helping public-sector organizations modernize critical information systems.

My focus is aligning design, architecture, and development through shared processes, federated design systems, and human-centered methods. I build design maturity across teams, mentor designers, and create frameworks that scale design impact into decision-making and organizational learning.

**Current focus:** renewal of CGI’s Facta product design, steering the design-system program, and research on informal leadership in design teams (Master’s thesis, Tampere University).

**Skills:** UX leadership, information architecture, design ops, portfolio management, facilitation, accessibility.

**Education:**  
- Master’s (Computer Science), University of Tampere — UX/Interactive Technology  
- Master’s studies (Automation & Hydraulics), Tampere University of Technology

**Languages:** English (professional), Swedish (elementary)
